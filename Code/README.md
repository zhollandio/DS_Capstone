# Sponsor has turned off Vertex AI workbench instance (JupyterLab we used for Modeling portion). There are several notebooks that we used to implement the modeling phase that we cant get access to. They have no responded to a request to turn it back on. Can provide screenshot if needed. This has an additional 4-5 notebooks of our modeling code
